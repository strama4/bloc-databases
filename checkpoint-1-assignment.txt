1. 1) String
   2) Integer
   3) String. Could also be considered a integer depending on how it stored on the system. 
   4) Float
   5) Float

2. A database would be used when there is a lot of information being stored that follows a 
logical pattern of organization. The data that is being provided is predictable and can be 
categorized for each new data point that is collected. 

A text file works better when the data is free flowing and with much less of a pattern. Free 
form writing is not consistent in either the order in which the information is provided nor the 
format that it typed in. It would be difficult to break something like an essay in category 
headers and fit the information in in a productive way.

3. SQL requires that you provide what you want the result of the search query to be. In other 
programming languages, you are asked to write what is supposed to happen as opposed to what the 
result is supposed to be. In programming, your hope is that what you write will result in the 
answer, whereas in SQL, you simply ask for the information you are looking for.


4. Databases allow you to organize data by characteristics that are common across most of the 
data that you have collected. By the way they are set up, it allows you to look up both 
specific information about an individual data point while at the same time being able to find 
relevant trends across all data points by organizing data according to the common category 
types.
 
5. Databases are made up of of columns, rows and cells (that contain various types of values). 
The columns represent a specific type of data relevant across all (or at least most) of the 
data set in the table. The row organizes the table according to each data point. The cells 
contain the value of the cross section between a category and that data point's value for that 
category. The table encompasses all of the rows, columns and values to provide a platform to be 
able to effectively traverse both the categories and the data points (and their values).

6. Strings, integers and objects.

7. Find all of the associated date and amounts that are found in the payments' table.

	'2016-05-01', 1500.00
	'2016-05-10', 37.00
	'2016-05-15', 124.93
	'2016-05-23', 54.72

   Find all of the amounts in the payments table that are over 500.
	
	'1500.00'


   Find all relevant data in the payments' table where the payee is 'Mega Foods'.
	
	'2016-05-15', 'Mega Foods', 124.93, 'Groceries'

8.
